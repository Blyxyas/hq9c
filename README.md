# HQ9+ Compiler

HQ9c (Or HQ9+ Compiler) is a blockchain-based NFT minting AI machine-learning cloud infraestructure for the compiling of the great programming language HQ9+ written in Rust using a C# FFI written in ASM.

Unlike other tools I made, this actually works! And it produces an executable through the Rust compiler to LLVM, then to C, then to Python, finally to Java ðŸ¤® bytecode and to an executable.

# How does it work, master Shifu?

The highly complicated HQ9+ programming language isn't easy to understand, but I'll do my best to explain it in a way your mortal mind can understand.

The HQ9+ programming language has 4 characters:

* H
* Q
* 9 *(My favourite)*
* \+

## H

The **"H"** character is powerful, one could say almost as powerful as the divine letter ***H***. It houses the unlimited power of the 12 character phrase *"Hello world!"*.

We all learned programming with the mythical *"hi mom im learning scratch"* and this reminds us of those times, long time before all these block chain based JS/TS blazingly fast AI machine learning API frameworks. *ugh*

Yes. **"H"** prints "Hello world!" to the standard output.

## Q

Even tho not as powerful as **H**, **Q** (for *âœ¨ queen âœ¨*) also can have great powers, even curing alzheimer's, reminding you of your highly complicated and complex HQ9+ source code. This can be used as to flex to your friends that you made that whole code yourself, without showing your IDE is [Eclipse](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ðŸ¤®. If you're having problems with this, understand that this is an epidemic, and you can enter Eclipse's rehab [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

Your thoughts are, *indeed*, correct. **"Q"** prints the source code to the standard output.

## 9

The nineth number (actually, eighth) is the most complex command for the compiler, and the most complex command for *you*. This is one of the new additions of the HQ9+22 spec.

**9** prints the **whole. cannonical lyrics to 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall**. That song where you violently destroy your wall by hitting it with rock-hard beer bottles. Just like a pirate.

**Attention!** You'll need it to understand the following paragraph.

There's a secret compiler option, that can only be found in the **secret help menu**. I'll not tell you where this menu lies, because that's your problem. Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

With that option, you can change the numbe
r of +bottles................

sorry my cat shat on the keyboard while I was typing.

So, with that option you *could* change the number of bottles, that, *indeed*, are thrown to the wall in order to destroy it like a caveman.

Then you can go climb a couply of trees just to reinforce your new caveman state.


## +

The **+** operator... It brings me so much joy of my infantile years, when I wasn't old and decrepit, almost dead.

This is the first thing we learn in school (I think), and it's so important in our daily lives, like... To be honest I just let the machine do its job.

Some of you are greatly utterly incorrect about the use of the accumulator, I can **even** cite this [Stack Overflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2766750).

> It's a joke.

No JÃ¶rg W Mittag from Stack Overflow. It's not a joke, the accumulator is a code optimization nexus in which code lie between life and dead.

No, the accumulator **can't be printed**, but that doesn't make it a less valuable thing, take into account that this "joke" is a 25% of our features.

Even more than that. I could **intercept** the very specific RAM address of the accumulator and read its value while the program takes place. **Then what?! EH? JÃ¶rg W Mittag from Stack Overflow?!**

# Installation & Usage

I hope you read all of the above information, because it's a highly valuable read, that I left *just for you.*

The way to install is to:

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blyxyas/hq9c.git
```

2. Build the project with [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo).

I know, this can be a little be challenging, I'll take your hand for this process...

Execute the following command:
```
sh ./makemakefile
```

This `sh ./makemakefile` will make the Makefile file to make the project, finally we can execute the makefile with make.

```
make
```

This will create the executable into `.target/release/hq9c`
Now you could create a symlink in your `/usr/bin` directory, or maybe you just want to use it a local project and not on a global scale (Thought it's highly recommended).

# Inspiration

I want to thank my family for this genious idea that I had. I also want to thank my giant fat cat *Keepy* and my mini skinny cat *Mina*, and, how'd I forget, I really want to thank the creator of this marvelous language [Cliff L. Biffle.](https://cliffle.com/) and [this another implementation](https://github.com/LucasLarson/HQ9) (this time it's an interpreter.) by Lucas Larson for giving me the idea for creating a compiler.
